This rep is used to run simulations for the paper [Non-asymptotic Staffing of Service Systems with a Finite Population](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4668481).

Please see the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Xiaobing-S/Staffing-Finite-Service-Systems---Simulation/blob/main/SimulationReport.ipynb) for the results of different cases.
